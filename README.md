## General Comments

In general, this represents an effort to practice three different components of a data-science work-flow:

1. An EDA of the dataset followed up by a predictive model to determine what the adoption status
2. An executive summary of the results of the preceeding work.
3. A Shiny app that sits on top of model and allows users to engage with the model predictions.

## Dataset Background
This project examines a dataset which was found on the Austin open data initiative, which can be found in the following location: https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238


This dataset is a set of outcomes of animals taken in by the Austin Animal Shelter, the largest no-kill animal shelter in the country. The Austin Animal Shelter has the mission goal of providing live outcomes to atleast 90% of animals taken in (more information about the no-kill plan can be found here http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Animal_Services/aac_no_kill_implementation_plan.pdf). The shelter does allow Euthanasia outcomes to occur under the following circumstances:

1. The animal has a terminal medical condition which causes great suffering with little hope for respite.

OR

2. Serious aggression issues pose a health and safety risk which has been identified and agreed upon by a behaviorist to pose a threat to the community regardless of the care it is housed in.
